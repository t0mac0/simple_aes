# A simple AES implementation

I was a little frustrated at the lack of easy-to-understand
implementations of AES on the web, so I wrote my own with help from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and especially
@samboy ([Sam Trenholme](http://samiam.org/rijndael.html)). Thanks!

Please note that this is intended as a reference of sorts, not as a production-ready,
fast and secure implementation. You probably shouldn't use this; use GPG instead.
