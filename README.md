# A simple AES implementation

I was a little frustrated at the lack of easy-to-understand
implementations of AES on the web, so I wrote my own with help from
[Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and especially
@samboy ([Sam Trenholme](samiam.org/rijndael.html)). Thanks!

At this time, only 128-bit AES is implemented, and I should
add more comments explaining things. This will hopefully happen soon.
